Assignment dealing with complex number and linklist
Header files are created.
Complex header file is created.
Copy your complex class into header.
In complex header delete all functions implementations so that only functions declaraions with semicolon remains.
Repeat the process for linked list.
In the end we have two header files, one main and two cpps.
in the proram we did the following steps:
First the class of complex numbers is created with the helper functions of add, sub, multiply and divide.
The exception logic is also added like in divide fumction.
Now another class linked list is created which can handle complex ADTs defined above and these supports insert at end, delete at a given position, value at position, insert after a given position and then in the end print the list.
In the main file linked list is created which stores 4,5 amd 3,-3 and -4,3.
The first two numbers are added and are stored in the list.
Subtract 1 and 3 and then store them at last.
Multiply 2 and 3 and also store them at last.
Divide 1 and 3 and delete the element at 4 and at element at last.
Moreover the list is printed after each step.
There is also read me file which is this also with the source code and the output screenshot after each step.
Add comments and proper indentationss.
